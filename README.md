Course Objective:

The Health Tracking App that I developed focuses on providing a comprehensive platform for users to track and monitor their health metrics such as steps walked, calories burned, calories consumed, and hours of sleep. Through this project, I aimed to achieve the following objectives:

Develop a Java-based Health Tracking Application:

The app was built using Java's Swing library to create an interactive GUI. The focus was on designing a user-friendly interface that allows easy input and visualization of health data.
Track and Log Health Data:

I implemented features to log health data (e.g., steps, calories, sleep hours) daily, allowing users to monitor their health progress over time. This taught me how to manage and update dynamic data in an application.
Set Health Goals and Monitor Progress:

The app allows users to set daily health goals (steps, calories burned, and sleep hours) and monitor their progress. I learned how to calculate progress as a percentage and update the UI dynamically based on user input.
Implement File Handling for Data Export:

The app includes functionality to export health data to a file. This gave me hands-on experience with file handling, specifically FileWriter and IOExceptions, ensuring that users' data could be saved and shared.
Handle User Inputs and Provide Feedback:

I implemented input validation (e.g., checking for valid numbers) and provided real-time feedback to users, improving the overall user experience. This helped me understand how to manage user interactions effectively.
Create a Modular and Extensible Codebase:

By structuring the app in a modular way, I followed object-oriented programming principles, ensuring the code is maintainable and scalable for potential future improvements, such as adding new features or integrating with other health devices.
Data Storage and Historical Tracking:

The app stores daily health data in a map, allowing users to view and track their historical progress. This taught me how to work with collections and data structures to manage a growing dataset over time.
Understand Real-world Health Management Systems:

This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of how real-world health tracking systems work, such as setting personal health goals, logging data, and reviewing progressâ€”skills that are highly applicable in health tech development.
Through this project, I learned how to build a health tracking application that integrates data entry, progress monitoring, goal setting, and file export functionality. It helped me strengthen my skills in GUI development, file handling, event-driven programming, and data management.
